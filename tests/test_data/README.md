### simple_collection.json

- Basic collection with 2 requests (GET and POST)
- Contains collection-level variables
- Tests basic parsing functionality

### nested_collection.json

- Complex nested folder structure with 3 levels of nesting
- Contains 5 requests across multiple folders
- Tests folder navigation, recursive iteration, and hierarchical auth/variables
- Includes different authentication types at different levels

### auth_collection.json

- Collection demonstrating various authentication types

### invalid_collection.json

- Valid JSON but invalid Postman collection structure (missing required fields)
- Tests collection validation error handling

## Usage

These files are used by the integration tests in `test_integration.py` to validate:

- End-to-end parsing workflows
- Complex nested structures
- Authentication type handling
- Event and script parsing
- Error handling scenarios
- Search and navigation functionality
